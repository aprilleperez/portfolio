#Takeaways
When comparing this portfolio with my previously-made portfolios, I feel that I am more confident in my ability to read/write and manipulate front-end DOM code to efficiently create web applications. Instead of using Bootstrap/CSS framework, I opted for a starter template that uses both jQuery and Sass for the dynamic function of the site. I find that being able to work efficiently while having a grasp of the foundations of what the given code is doing is what helps to make an employer-competitive developer. I had the most fun creating this portfolio since I not only understood what I was manipulating, but cut down my work in half by using my readily-available resources from the community. This portfolio will continue to be updated as the course goes.
